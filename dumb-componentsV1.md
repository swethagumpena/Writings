# DUMB COMPONENTS

## Introduction
When you‚Äôre working with React.js or React Native, you‚Äôll notice the power and versatality that comes with components. Components are the building blocks of a React application. Individual components are created and then nested together to build up an app. These components save us time by decomposing the user interface into reusable code, and this, makes our code easier to read and understand. 
Components are broadly classified into two categories:
1. Smart Components
2. Dumb Components

## What makes components smart or dumb?
Smart component are app-level components that perform functions and handle data, while dumb components are primarily concerned with the user interface. Let's dive deep into what this actually means.

### Dumb Components
* Dumb components, or ‚Äòpresentational‚Äô components are stateless components (in most cases) which only present something to the DOM. 
*  It displays exactly what it is provided with. No changes, no modifications üòå. 
* Much more efficient than a stateful one, because they don't require as many computer resources to render (memory, CPU, and GPU in terms of graphic-intensive apps).
* Have no dependencies with the rest of the app (such as actions or stores) 
* Rarely have their own state (when they do, it‚Äôs UI state rather than data)

In short, a dumb component just gets all of its states from the parent component and raises events when something happens. It has no context of the application, but makes it very **reusable**!


Examples: Header and footer. 
The component can be written in one place and used several times throughout the app, just render, and each instance of that component will look the same. If you want to change how it looks, you only have to change it in one place. This change is then reflected in all the places this component is used.

### Smart Components
* Smart components, or 'container' components on the other hand are stateful components. 
* Keep track of the state and all the changes. 
* Have a mighty responsibilty to work on life-cycle methods, capture changes, APIs, libraries, etc., and have to pass them down to the other components of the application. 
* They have to offer functionality to the app, after all (Phew!) 
*  Do the heavy lifting üèãÔ∏è and pass the data down to the presentational components as props. 
* These components maintain state and also often contain callback functions to update the state. 
* Are usually generated using higher order components such as connect() from React Redux.

These smart components should inject app level services. They get state and call methods and finally pass on this information to the dumb components.

Example - The app component is an example of a smart component. The app component is responsible for maintaining several pieces of state for the entire app. It also passes down additional functions to its child components so that the state can be updated when a user interacts with the site.

### More examples
1. A TextInput Component: Dumb

A **Text Input component** expects props such as value, labelText and an onChange function. 

```JavaScript
export default TextInput = ({value, label, handleInputChange}) => {
    <label for="textInput">{label}</label>
    <input type="text" value={value} name="textInput" id="textInput" onChange={handleInputChange} />
```
This TextInput component can be used in different places by just modifying the props that are being passed. This component  will have a different value, label and onChange function based on where it's used and what props are being  passed. All of the props are 'Contextually Relevant' i.e., they are relevant to the context in which they're placed. This component is dumb and only renders what is being passed to it, without any changes. 

## Benefits of having smart and dumb components
1. Better separation of concerns. The app is easier to manage and modify.

2. Better reusability. You can use the same presentational component with completely different sources that can be used in multiple places.
3. Presentational components allows the designer tweak all their variations without touching the app‚Äôs logic. This allows us to extract ‚Äúlayout components‚Äù such as Sidebar, Page, Header, Footer and use props to determine what to display instead of duplicating the same markup and layout in several container components.
